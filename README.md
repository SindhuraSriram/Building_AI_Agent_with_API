# Building AI Agents using API

## Introduction

This project provides a practical guide to building AI agents using APIs. It includes hands-on examples, structured workflows, and reusable code snippets to help developers integrate AI capabilities into their projects efficiently.

## What You Will Learn

- How to build AI-driven workflows using APIs.
- Implementing structured AI processes for various applications.
- Utilizing tools for retrieval, processing, and decision-making.
- Practical examples demonstrating real-world AI use cases.

## Project Structure

This repository is structured to guide developers through different stages of AI agent development:

- **Introduction**: Basic concepts and examples to get started.
- **Workflow Patterns**: Organizing AI workflows effectively with structured patterns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SindhuraSriram/Building_AI_Agent_with_API.git
   cd Building_AI_Agent_with_API
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run an example from the Introduction folder:
   
   ```sh
   python Introduction/1-basic.py
   ```

### Running Workflow Patterns

The `workflow-patterns` folder contains structured AI workflows that demonstrate how to build AI agents efficiently. You can run the individual Python files as follows:

Basic workflow example:
   
   ```sh
   python workflow-patterns/1-basic.py
   ```

Structured AI process example:
   
   ```sh
   python workflow-patterns/2-structured.py
   ```

Using tools within workflows:
   
   ```sh
   python workflow-patterns/3-tools.py
   ```

Retrieval-based AI process:
   
   ```sh
   python workflow-patterns/4-retrieval.py
   ```
